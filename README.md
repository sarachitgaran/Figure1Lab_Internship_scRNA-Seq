# Figure1Lab-Internship-scRNA-Seq üìù

## Introduction

Welcome to my internship project repository. This project aim to helps students to hone their compbio skills by emulating an internship in biotech/pharma company. The goal is to determine the efficacy of anti cancer drugs by exploring single cell RNA-Seq data in cancer cell line.

This repository is dedicated to my progress of diving deep into the realm of scRNA-seq where I summarize papers I read and share codes as well as my own thoughts.

**Week1 Memo**
The first week of the internship is devoted to the literature review in order to learn the neccessary content that will be of use in the following weeks. I have to address the Key Scientific Questions (KSQ) and paraphrase it with my own words.


## Original Question

The original question provided for the first week's task is: **"Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers??
 +Trastuzumab: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.
 +Bevacizumab: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer."**

### Literature Review

In order to break down the question into its buildig blocks, first I need to have a somewhat comprehensive literature review regarding the biology and methodolgy of the question we have in mind.

__Cancer cell line__

Cancer Cell line Encyclopedia project was established in 2006 as a result of the collaboration between Braod Institute and Novartis Institute. It is like an equivalent of TCGA for cancer cell lines.

help us for the genome-wide characterization of the cancer cell lines
provide us with valusbale information regarding large-scale characterization of cancer cell lines and their response to compounds or cell perturbation which ultimately would be helpful to reveal the predictive drug sensetivities of different cancer.
good model for testing the drugs
all models have their own pros and cons.
although they may not capture everything as ...
complexity and heterogeneity 
cancer is a complex disease. There are more than 220 types of cancer.
they have their own differences but the fundamental principle of all of them is uncontrolled cell proliferation which result in tumors formation in the specific part of the body and ultimatley metastasis to other organs.
